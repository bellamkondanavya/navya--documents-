# Obs recording documents
Here are some known settings -  
-   select 720 p ( do not keep auto)
-   select 2x ( speed, do not record at 1.x)
-   select full screen when recording.
-   its ok to record multiple lessons in single video. we can split/edit/crop them later

**Known issues :**  

-   When there is a non-video , the recording stops. So, recording must be checked every one hour . Skip quizzes,non-video lessons
-   Do not record more than 2 hours in single go. It might cause problems with OBS
-   select mp4 in OBS, else, the video size could be too large
-   should close the RDP session, once the recording starts. Anyone should be able to connect to the RDP and continue work. This task should not be dependent on any one person.
